## Choosy Todo

This is simple and tiny todo app which manages a list of todos(creating, deleting and marking as done.)

It recommends the task the be perfomed next depending on the priority of each of the task.

## Getting started

> We recommend to fork this repository to your GitHub account before you get started,
> which makes it much easier to hand in the solution when you are done.

Ensure you have Elixir 1.14 and Erlang/OTP 25 installed.
We recommend using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/),
in which case you can use the `.tool-versions` file in this repository,
to setup your development environment.

Once your enviroment is prepared, run `mix setup` from the root directory of this repository,
to compile the project and initialize the development database.

Finally start the Phoenix server with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`.

Now you can visit [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser and interact with the application.

> **Note**
> There is nothing special about this application,
> so if you get stuck you can always have a look at the [official Phoenix docs](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.7.1/installation.html).
